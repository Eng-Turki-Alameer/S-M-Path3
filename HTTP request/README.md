# Making HTTP Requests with Python-Requests
-----------------
What is HTTP?
HTTP is a set of protocols designed to enable communication between clients and servers. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.
So, to request a response from the server, there are mainly two methods:
1. GET : to request data from the server.
2. POST : to submit data to be processed to the server.
